<p>Dye ken John Peel with his coat so gay. This was published in 1982 on the Reynard album Pass the Jug Round. Dye ken John Peel at the break of day Dye ken John Peel when hes far away With his hounds and his horn in the morning. Words John Woodcock Graves music trad Mickey Moscrop sang John Peel in a recording made in 1953 in either the Crown and Thistle Rockcliffe or the Plough Inn Wreay. This is an old English song with a brisk pace so the chord changes are quite fast but there are only 3 chords so if you can change quickly between D A7 ang G give it a go - its a fun tune though the subject is a bit grim.</p>
